            <li>¼ small sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed rosemary</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 thick slices Italian bread</li>    
            <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 slice sharp American cheese (such as Cooper®)</li>    
            <li>1 slice provolone cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion 
                until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. </li>
            <li>Mix remaining 1 tablespoon butter, rosemary, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and
                 pepper in a small bowl. Spread on one side of each slice of bread. </li>
            <li>Place 1 slice of bread buttered-side down in the skillet. Top with onion,
                 mozzarella cheese, American cheese, and provolone cheese. 
                Cover with second slice of bread, buttered-side up. Cook until
                 golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula; cook until 
                second side is browned and cheeses are melted, about 3 minutes more. </li>
